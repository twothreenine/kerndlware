Current problem:
see issue #22 in GitHub


- new classes Invoice & Payment (date -> prepaid expense?)
- Commodity is a Consumable is a Product; Decive is a Durable is a Product
- Batch/Material/IntangibleAsset/TangibleAsset is an Asset
- Specific Purchase n...1 Asset
- Payment n...m SpecificPurchase
- Invoice n...m SpecificPurchase

- Balance sheet (assets and liabilities)

- ods import script: Stocktaking (type 5/6) -> taking/restitution resp. stocktaking? batch, amount
- after that: import data anew and check for errors
- Insertion sheet

- use Django user class instead of own class
- SQL statt Sqlite?

New menu:
- Block script in pages should extend block script of base, not override it (parent tag doesn't work)

membership phases:
- try performance (and at runserver)
- Timer/schedule
