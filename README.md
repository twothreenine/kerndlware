The project is about creating an accounting software for storage-based non-profit foodcoops.

It is web based and written in Python/Django.
An internet connection will not be required to run the programm, but we imagine to add some online features.
We plan to include many useful features to manage the stock, to plan orders, and to analyse consumption by participants.

The project is in an early stage and by far not ready for use.
You can support us by:
- contributing your knowledge about accounting principles and terms
- suggestions which features could be useful and how they could be displayed user-friendly
- joining coding

The code is in English, yet we speak German and can use German comments as well.
German translation will be included in the first final version, as we plan to use the program in our own foodcoop.
